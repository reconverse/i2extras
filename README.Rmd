# Scope

*i2extras* adds additional functionality to the
[incidence2](https://github.com/reconverse/incidence2) package.

# What does it do?

The main features of the package include:

- `fit_curve()` and `growth_rate()`: fit a trend (poisson / negative
  binomial) to an `incidence2` object and calculate the associated growth
  rate.

- `add_rolling_average()`: add a rolling average to an `incidence2` object.

- `bootstrap()`: generates a bootstrapped `incidence2` object by re-sampling,
  with replacement, the original dates of events.

- `find_peak()`: locates the peak time of the epicurve.

- `estimate_peak()`: uses bootstrap to estimate the peak time (and related
  confidence interval) of a partially observed outbreak.
