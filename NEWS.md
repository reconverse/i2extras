# i2extras 0.2.0

* {i2extras} now explicitly 'Depends' on the upstream
  [{incidence2}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=incidence2) package and
  enforces a minimum version requirement upon this (i.e. incidence2 >= 2.0.0).
  
* `fit_curve()` and the corresponding plotting method, `plot.incidence2_fit()`
  have been adapted to account for the new structure and plotting methods of
  `<incidence2>` objects.

* `find_peak()` is now a wrapper around the `keep_peaks()` function from 
  the underlying incidence2 package.
  
* `add_rolling_average()` is no longer a generic function and will now error if
  not called on an `<incidence2>` object. It now returns the original input with
  additional rolling average columns but does not change the underlying objects
  class. Internally the code has been refactored to make use of
  `data.table::frollmean()` and function arguments updated accordingly. Due to
  the changes to `add_rolling_average()`, the plot method for
  `<incidence2_rolling>` objects has been removed.
  
* `estimate_peak()` can now (optionally) return multiple peaks.
  
* `fit_model()` is now defunct and will error if called.

# i2extras 0.1.2

* patch release due to changes in the upstream incidence2 package.

# i2extras 0.1.0

* updated to work with the latest version (1.0.0) of
[incidence2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=incidence2)
* `growth_rate()` now has an `include_warnings` parameter to match plot
functionality.
* Added `flag_low_counts()` function to highlight low counts below a specified
threshold.

# i2extras 0.0.2

* Initial release
